### Explanation of the script:
###
### 1. Reading the file:
###  - The function `get_lines(test=False)` reads lines from `config.csv` by default or from `test.csv` if `test=True`.
###  - It ensures the file is opened and reads each line while stripping whitespace.
###  - The lines are returned one by one using a generator.
###
### 2. Validating and extracting `mul(X, Y)` instructions:
###  - The function `solution_1(memory_dumps)` uses a regular expression to find patterns like `mul(X, Y)` where `X` and `Y` are integers.
### - It extracts all valid `mul(X, Y)` instructions and calculates their products using the helper function `sum_muls`.
###
### 3. Excluding invalid instructions:
###  - The function `solution_2(memory_dumps)` excludes instructions that appear after a `don't()` marker.
### - It processes memory dumps by splitting sections based on `do()` and `don't()`, taking only the valid parts.
###
### 4. Error handling for robustness:
###  - The script assumes the existence of `config.csv`. Missing files will raise a `FileNotFoundError`.
###  - Any additional issues during parsing or computation are handled by Pythonâ€™s default exception system to avoid abrupt crashes.
###
### 5. **User-friendly default behavior**:
###  - The script reads from `config.csv` unless specified otherwise.
### - The user is informed of any errors through exception messages.
###
### 6. **Output**:
###  - The script calculates the total sum of products from valid `mul(X, Y)` instructions, excluding those invalidated by `don't()`.
### - The result is printed in German as `Gesamtsumme der Ergebnisse: {total_sum}`.
