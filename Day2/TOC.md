# Day2
1. [Day2_Part1](Day2_Part1.py)  
   The script reads a list containing numerical reports, validates each report based on specific criteria (strictly increasing or decreasing sequences with adjacent differences between 1 and 3), and calculates the number of valid "safe" reports, outputting the result.
2. [Day2_Part2](Day2_Part2.py)  
   The script reads a list containing numerical reports, validates if they are safe based on specific rules, and determines how many can be considered safe either directly or by applying the Problem Dampener, which allows making a report safe by removing a single number.
